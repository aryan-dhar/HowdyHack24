            Welcome to our Mental Health Peer Support Forum, a platform dedicated to providing a safe and supportive space for individuals to discuss mental health topics. Our website is built with the aim of promoting openness and understanding through anonymous peer-to-peer interactions. Here, users can create posts, share their stories, and provide support to others through comments. 
            <br><br>
            The website offers:
            <ul>
                <li>Anonymized peer support through forum-style discussions.</li>
                <li>Dedicated pages with resources for mental health issues, including depression and suicide hotlines.</li>
                <li>A safe space to share personal experiences without judgment.</li>
            </ul>
            We used several technologies to bring this project to life, including:
            <ul>
                <li>HTML & CSS for structuring and styling the webpage.</li>
                <li>JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.</li>
                <li>Node.js for backend development and managing server-side operations.</li>
                <li>Express.js to handle routing and APIs.</li>
                <li>MongoDB for storing and retrieving posts and comments in a database.</li>
            </ul>
